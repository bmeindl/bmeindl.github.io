Thank you for considering contributing to my personal website! Here's how to get started.

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch**: Always create a branch for your changes
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**: Update files as needed

3. **Commit your changes**: Use clear commit messages
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature X" 
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the GitHub repository and open a PR from your branch to main

6. **Code Review**: Wait for review and approval

7. **Merge**: After approval, merge your PR
